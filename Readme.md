### **Simplified App Idea:**

**Concept**:  
A web app that helps friends **split expenses**, **request loans**, and use a **chatbot** to manage finances easily.

### **Core Features**:

1. **Expense Splitting**:  
   - Users can add shared expenses (e.g., dinner, rent) and the app calculates who owes whom.
   - Track group expenses (trips, shared living costs) with automatic calculations.

2. **Loan from Friends**:  
   - Users can borrow small amounts from friends and set repayment schedules.
   - Track loans, repayments, and send reminders.

3. **AI Chatbot**:  
   - Users can talk to a chatbot to add expenses (e.g., “Add Rs20 dinner with Mike”).
   - Ask the chatbot about balances, due payments, or debts.

4. **Simple Credit Score**:  
   - Users build a basic credit score based on their timely loan repayments.
   - The higher the score, the more you can borrow from friends.

5. **Payment Integration**:  
   - Users can directly make payments to friends through the app using PayPal, Stripe, or UPI.
